Net Migration Analysis Report using random_forest Regressor
=======================================================================

Overview
--------
This report provides an analysis and prediction of net migration using the random_forest Regressor model. The model is trained on a dataset containing various features related to migration, and its performance is evaluated using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).

Model Performance
-----------------
- Train RMSE: 0.10
- Test RMSE: 0.23

Generated Plots and Their Interpretations
-----------------------------------------
The following plots are generated and saved in the `plots` directory:

1. Histogram of Net_Migration (random_forest_histogram_0619_01.png)
   - Shows the distribution of net migration values in the dataset.
   - Useful to understand the spread and central tendency of migration data.

2. Distribution of Residuals (random_forest_distribution_0619_02.png)
   - Displays the distribution of the residuals (errors) from the model's predictions.
   - Helps identify any patterns or biases in the model's predictions.

3. Scatter Plot of Predicted vs. Actual Values (random_forest_scatter_0619_03.png)
   - Plots the predicted net migration values against the actual values.
   - A good fit is indicated by points lying close to the diagonal line.

4. Feature Importance Plot (random_forest_feature_importance_0619_04.png)
   - Shows the importance of each feature used in the model.
   - Helps understand which factors are most influential in predicting net migration.

5. Residuals vs. Predicted Values Plot (random_forest_residuals_vs_predicted_0619_05.png)
   - Plots residuals against predicted values.
   - Useful for detecting heteroscedasticity and other patterns in the residuals.

6. Predicted vs. Actual Values Line Plot (random_forest_predicted_vs_actual_line_0619_06.png)
   - Line plot showing predicted and actual values across the test data points.
   - Useful for visually inspecting the model's performance over the dataset.

7. Cumulative Explained Variance by PCA (random_forest_cumulative_explained_variance_0619_07.png)
   - Shows the cumulative explained variance by the principal components.
   - Useful for understanding the variance explained by the PCA components.

8. Pairplot of Key Features (random_forest_pairplot_0619_08.png)
   - Pairwise plots of key features and their relationships.
   - Helps visualize correlations and interactions between features.

Conclusion
----------
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of net migration using the random_forest model. The generated plots and metrics help in understanding the factors influencing migration and the effectiveness of the model in predicting migration patterns.
